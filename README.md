## Hello! 👋

I'm Anthony, a computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in C++ and parallel computing for performance optimization, programming languages and machine learning. I'm still looking for a project to coalesce these interests, so feel free to reach out to me at ayip2@andrew.cmu.edu!

In the meantime, check out some of my projects:
- [CSerpent](https://github.com/rbdannenberg/cserpent)🐍: The research project I'm currently working on. A compiler for a typed Pythonic language to native C++, aiming for an order-of-magnitude speedup. I'm writing both the performant runtime system in C++ as well as the backend semantic routines for code generation. We're still looking for help, so reach out!
- [CMR Driverless Controls](https://cmr.red/controls-docs)🚗: As captain of the controls team, we've developed a state-of-the-art model predictive controller (MPC) for our Formula SAE driverless racecar, 22a. It uses the MPPI algorithm's tremendous parallelizability to simulate a million trajectories per second to gun the car at 30mph on an unseen track. This year, we're aiming to make it even faster. While our codebase is still private, I prepared some docs in the hopes of supporting new driverless teams.
- [nnUNet](https://github.com/anthony-yip/nnUNet/tree/nnunetv1)👁️: During an internship with A*STAR, I added semi-supervised training onto the nnUNet framework to make use of unlabeled medical imaging data. This work was based off version 1 of nnUNet, hence the fork from that branch.
- [Automajumper](https://github.com/DarioQuintero/Automajumper)🎮: A Unity game I made with my friends from CMU's Game Creation Society. It's a rhythm platformer based on Conway's Game of Life. I wanted to do something other than code, so I took charge of Level Design instead. You can play the game [here](https://yuxiang-huang.itch.io/automajumper)!
- [Booth](https://github.com/Niaolan27/Claw-Machine-Booth-2024)👋: As Electricals chair for the Singapore Student's Association's Spring Carnival Booth, we made a fully-functional claw machine spanning the 2.4m wide booth using magnets an an Arduino.
